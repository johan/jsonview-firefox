detailed_description=Normally when encountering a JSON document (content type "application/json"), Firefox simply prompts you to download the file. With the JSONView extension, JSON documents are shown in the browser similar to how XML documents are shown. The document is formatted, highlighted, and arrays and objects can be collapsed.  Even if the JSON document contains errors, JSONView will still show the raw text.\nOnce you've got JSONView installed, check out http://brh.numbera.com/software/jsonview/example.json to see the extension in action!\n\nNote: If you're getting an error like "invalid file hash" when you try to install JSONView from addons.mozilla.org, you need to make sure to accept third-party cookies from addons.mozilla.org and addons.mozilla.com. It's a bug in their site. This problem will go away whenever JSONView is let out of the "sandbox".
developer_comments=Known bugs:\n* "Save as..." saves HTML instead of the original JSON document.\n* "Page Info" panel reports content as HTML instead of JSON.\n* Copying and pasting from the formatted JSON does not copy the original document.\n* JSON documents larger than 8KB can fail to display properly.
